Meet on 16 sept
1) Detection of the 3 target ions (Ammonium, Nitrate, Nitrite) in the liquid analyte samples through Titration constituted the agenda.

2) A thorough literature review on methods of detection was proposed & recommended.

3) The Titration can be done using 2 pathways: (A) Volumetric / Colorimetric (detecting colour change on reaction/precipitation) (B) Conductometric (Change in Conductivity of solution)

4) A previous attempt at designing an Optoelectronic Devices (Colorimetric titrations through electronics) for the Ammonium Ion was found:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092083/

5) A paper discussing Conductometric Titration for Chloride ions was found:

6) The field of microfluidics came up briefly. The lack of accuracy in previous Finflow realizations was also mentioned.

7) An interesting paper which discussed an app for Titrations for colour-blind students was found : https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00027#

basics of arduino
made basic circuit 
 our circuit problem : 
    motor didn't worked due to volate of our circuit is 9v and motor is 2.7v so, we need to connect another circuit ...so that overall voltage of circuit is 2.7v
